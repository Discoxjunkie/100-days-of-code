# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Started a new FCC project (personal portfolio)

**Thoughts:** I haven't really coded in a few weeks so i'm a little rusty, I'd like to get better at being able to figure things out quicker

**Link to work:** Practice Portfolio Building (https://discoxjunkie.github.io/FCCprotfolioproject/)
